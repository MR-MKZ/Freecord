## Privacy Policy

This software **does not** share any data to its owner/maintainers â€“ user
configuration, session details and cookies are saved locally. However because
this software connects to [Discord website](https://discord.com/app) as well as
Fosscord instances (depending on user selection), the application may share some
data or even track you depending on the Freecord's configuration. By default,
Freecord tries to protect the user privacy and does not grant sensitive
permissions as well as mitigate the tracing by blocking some of the unnecessary
request made by the client itself.
